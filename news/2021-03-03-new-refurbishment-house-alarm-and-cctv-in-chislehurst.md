We work alongside a lot of building companies and have built up a brilliant reputation with them. Our knowledge of what needs to be installed at what time and when to 1st fix and when to 2nd fix is what gives our customers peace of mind. This lovely refurbished bungalow in Chislehurst on the border with New Eltham has taken shape really quickly and we had to get our cables in for the [CCTV and alarm system](/categories/special-offers/) prior to the external render going on to hide all cabling, the last thing you want after spending money on a refurb is to then have cables clipped around, we also thought of dropping a BT cable down the wall from the gutter to the floor so that when it was installed from the telegraph pole, it didn\'t have to be clipped down the wall. The new [Burglar alarm](/categories/burglar-alarms/) security system features all the highest spec home alarm equipment and paired up with the 24 hour colour [cctv](/categories/cctv/) cameras present the perfect home security detterent.

If your home or business is being completely refurbished or if it has just been done, either way we can help to create you a [home security system and cctv package](/categories/special-offers/) that will suit your family and requirements.

Dont hesitate to [contact us](/contact/) if you have any questions.
