# Deterrent

We recently upgraded this property in Welling, Kent and the customer was unsure whether to upgrade the external siren as it \"still worked\" but we strongly advised that the greatest money spent on your [Burglar Alarm Security System](/categories/burglar-alarms/) is on exactly that, the external siren.

Put yourself for a minute, in the shoes of a would be intruder. Now, if you were walking past a potential target and see a really old looking siren on the front of one property compared to next door which had a backlit brand new siren, which would you choose to not bother attempting? We think that an up to date security system siren speaks volumes for your property and deters the would be thief away from your home/business and keeping your possessions safe.
