# No Cables?!?!

Our customer here Welling/Greenwich border on Shooters Hill was very apprehensive about getting an alarm installed as she hated cables being added.

Well thats where MyAlarm Security comes in, we have over 25Â years experience in our field and can spot how to lose a cable.

This was one of our [Smart Alarm](/categories/burglar-alarms/) App controlled Security Systems and although its wireless the main control unit does need a mains feed, but that\'s not a problem for us as you can see in this picture. The customer was amazed and even asked how it was possible.

We\'re really happy to keep our customers even happier.
