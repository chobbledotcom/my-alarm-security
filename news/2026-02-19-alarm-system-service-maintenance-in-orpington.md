We recently received a call from a resident who lived in Orpington who had a fault displayed on their burglar alarm. The fault was WIRLS Supervn F1, which normally indicates a low battery. They explained that they couldnt get in touch with the company that installed the system. They explained that the burglar alarm system last had a service in January 2025 by the same company. On their invoice, they was charged for all batteries - sensor battery replacements as well as the panel and siren batteries. When we attended, we was horrifed to find that the main control panel for the system had been taped shut! It didnt even have a screw in it! When we got up to the siren, we discovered that the date on the batteries was January 2022! So, either the customer was given 3 year old batteries at their alarm system maintenance a year ago, or they was charged for the batteries but never had them replaced!

We recycle all of our batteries however we are more than happy to leave the old batteries with the customer on our alarm system service and maintenance visits.

We are more than experienced to service any make and model of burglar alarm system regardless of who installed it. There isnt many alarm systems that we dont know including Pyronix, Scantronic, Menvier, Visonic, Texecom, Veritas, Eaton, Cooper, Galaxy, Honeywell etc. We can source parts and batteries for any system providing they are not obsolete.
