#### External Wireless Dualtech

# External wireless dualtech

Pyronix are the leaders in home security for building and [house alarms](/categories/burglar-alarms/) and are always evolving. They are always releasing new products to make your home even more secure. As our brand of choice, we bring to you the latest in home security.

We recently got asked by a customer in Ebbsfleet near Greenhithe in Kent for a solution to his dilemma. His property was the target for numerous thefts due to the size of the land. The house was quite far from where his garage and other out buildings were situated that were being targeted.

MyAlarm Security had the answer, we quoted for 4 external [colorvu 24hr colour cctv cameras](/categories/cctv/) with around 6 weeks of recordings, we paired this with the external dualtecs in various locations to give complete perimeter protection, triggering notifications through to the app so the customer could remotely view the buildings, visually verifying the area, and at the tap of the app could trigger the external siren if needed to scare off the would be intruders.

The [back lit siren, detectors](/categories/burglar-alarms/) and [CCTV](/categories/cctv/) are all a visual deterrent to hopefully stop any break ins or attempted break ins.

We have kept in touch with the customer and they report no other break ins.

Sometimes you have to imagine the outlay in cost as a long term investment as you don\'t always know how many burglars you have deterred from your property and any loss and damage caused out weighs the cost of any house alarm or CCTV.
