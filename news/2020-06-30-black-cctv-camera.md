# Black camera

This close up of a new black camera is a great idea to keep CCTV systems discreet as well as protected, We always give the customer the option of colours depending on their needs or preference.

This system was installed in Dartford on the Bexley border and the customer chose the black option, although at the time the black boxes for the CCTV cameras were out of stock across the whole country due to Covid.

Not a problem for us, as you\'ve seen before we carry a number of different spray paint colours to help us complete jobs to the highest standard, whether it\'s an [alarm system](/categories/burglar-alarms/) in your home or business in Bexley or a CCTV camera installation in New Eltham we have the ways and means to a perfect security system installation.
