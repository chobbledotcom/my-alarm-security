#### Pir Movement Sensor

# PIR Movement Sensor

The movement sensors we use are in our professional opinion - fantastic. Over the years we have used many different brands or burglar alarms and sensors and think that these are most definitely the best. When movement is detected, it will trigger your security alarm with an internal and external siren. Via the app, you will then be notified on your mobile device exactly where in the property the activation has occured.

I think the thing i really like about these are that the wired[ burglar alarm systems](/categories/burglar-alarms.php) and wireless versions look identical which is really nice for the end user because if we fit a hybrid system of wired and wireless security systems within your home or business premises, then we can keep the detectors universal and as aesthetically pleasing as possible.

Today we had a job in Sidcup, Bexley, Kent to add an additional wired detector to the existing house alarm system and as you can see with some tricky drilling we managed to make a wired sensor actually look wireless.

We\'re very proud to use all of our knowledge and expertise to give you guys the best finish we can.
