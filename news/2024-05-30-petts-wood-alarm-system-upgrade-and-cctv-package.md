We recently was asked to attend a property where the homeowner had sadly had their car stolen off of their drive. Car theft seems to be rife recently with more and more cars being stolen. 

The homeowners property was not broken into so the thieves obviously used some sort of jamming device to access the car and start it up to drive away.

The customers alarm system was over 20 years old and they had never used it. We upgraded their whole burglar alarm system and added the brand new Pyronix car defender to it for their new car. The car defender is a device that is linked up to your Pyronix home alarm system and when it feels vibration or is tilted in anyway, this activates your home alarm system triggering the siren. The car defender can be linked around the steering wheel so that if someone gets into your car and touches the steering wheel, if the alarm is activated, the siren on the house alarm will sound. 

We also added a 5 camera CCTV system to their property with two CCTV cameras at the front, one down the side and two at the rear with one covering the shed entrance.

Both systems will have app control allowing the homeowner to view the surroundings of his home from anywhere in the world - or from any room in the house. If you hear a sound at night, its quick and easy to view your cameras from your mobile phone.  The house alarm can also be set and unset from the app, allowing the homeowner to have total control over his home security.

The alarm system app allows certain zones/areas/rooms to be set at different times so that if you are in the property and would for example, just like the front door, garden door and certain room sensors to be set, this can be done from within the app as well, giving you total control over your system.

This homeowner is now protected with the latest Burglar Alarm System and CCTV in Petts Wood.
