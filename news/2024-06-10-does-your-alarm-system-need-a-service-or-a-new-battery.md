#### Does Your Alarm System Need A Service Or A New Battery?

# Does Your Alarm System Need A Service Or A New Battery? 

We often get phone calls from people who can no longer get hold of the original installer of their alarm system. Maybe the company was sold, the owners retired or the company was re-branded. Whatever the reason, this is definitely something we are able to help with.

[Burglar Alarm](/categories/burglar-alarms/) Systems & [CCTV](/categories/cctv/) - [Service, Repair, Upgrades, New Systems, Decommissions](/categories/servicing-and-repairs/). We are specialists in all types of home and business security with well over 25 years experience. There isn\'t many alarm panels on the market that we don\'t know. We offer alarm servicing & battery changes without the hefty contracted monthly and yearly payments. We understand that not everyone wants to be tied into a contract so we offer call outs as and when needed. You just pay for us when you need or want us. It doesn\'t matter that we didn\'t install your alarm system, having been in the trade for as long as we have, we know most panels inside out and carry stock including alarm batteries and replacement sensors on board our vans at all times.

Our market research has shown that our customers much prefer the freedom of not being tied into a contract. Some customers like to have their systems serviced every year or maybe your insurance stipulates this as part of your policy but we also found that some wanted to wait a little bit longer before having a service done. Whatever your reasons, we can help you out without the hefty monthly price tag.

So you have an existing intruder alarm system that you would like looked at, serviced, repaired or upgraded? Maybe the batteries need replacing or the keypad no longer works? Or maybe you\'re having decorating done or home improvements and need a sensor or door contact removed or replaced? Do you have an error message or warning light displayed or flashing on the alarm panel? One of the first things we will ask is \'what is the brand or model of alarm system that you have?\' Lots of alarm systems don\'t have any visible names on them, or maybe the name has rubbed off. Some alarm panels just have numbers on! Believe it or not, we can identify an alarm panel just from these numbers. Maybe your alarm system says Visonic or Veritas, or just has the numbers 9651. If you don't know the make or model of your system, just send us a photo of the alarm panel and we can identify it for you. Our email address is Sales@MyAlarmSecurity.Co.UK or [click here to contact us](/contact/) direct.
