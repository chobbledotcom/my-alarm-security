# CCTV Image

Here at MyAlarm Security we get asked a lot what the image quality is like on our home security [CCTV](/categories/cctv/) installations.

Well here is the answer to your queries. I\'m sure you\'ll agree that they are stunning, although this was still a building site in Petts Wood, [Orpington](/pages/orpington/) border the customer wanted the security system up and running.

So along with the [CCTV](/categories/cctv/) installation, we also had our app controlled smart home [burglar alarm](/categories/burglar-alarms/) security system in place so when locking up after a days work they were sure that their property was safe.
