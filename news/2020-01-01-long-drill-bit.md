#### Long Drill Bit

# Long Drill Bit

It\'s not often that we need drill bits like this one on Home security installations but when we do it\'s nice to have everything you need on board.

This drill bit is 10mm in diameter and a whopping 1 meter long, there isn\'t a wall we can\'t get through. This particular job was a home security [CCTV system](/categories/cctv.php) in Eltham/New Eltham borders and was installed after the customer had an incident with their car, now after the CCTV installation they can rest in the peace of mind that if there is an incident then it will be on camera. We offer a minimum of 30 days storage on our CCTV systems and they are all crisp HD images, and with the addition of our new ColorVu cameras you can pick out exact colours even in the dead of night, with conventional cameras dark colours are a mix of different shades of grey but with the new ColorVu CCTV you can tell the difference between dark blue and black.

Pair this with one of our [Home Alarms](/categories/burglar-alarms.php) and you have the perfect Home Security System. All of our Security options come with app control and can be accessed anywhere in the world as long as you have internet access on your phone, receive a notification from your alarm in [Bexley, Bexleyheath](/pages/bexley.php), [Orpington](/pages/orpington.php) and more straight to your phone and then check your CCTV System for visual verification, from the app you can screen shot incidents or screen record a video clip to share externally via Facebook, Whatsapp or Email.
