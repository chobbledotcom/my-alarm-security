We have everything you need for your home security needs, from upgrading an existing system to a complete full app controlled [burglar alarm and cctv system](/categories/servicing-and-repairs/). This customer in Chislehurst had a basic system around 20 years old which kept going off at all hours of the day and night giving the customer (and their neighbours) many sleepless nights.

The customer called us to ask for a quotation to upgrade and whilst on site we had a quick look at no charge to see if we could identify the fault to at least silence the system and give the customer a good nights sleep. Not only did we identify that the back up battery was most likely the culprit but we also disconnected it due to it being swollen and leaking and being a potential fire hazard. We left a safe system that was no longer going to disrupt her sleep.

On the security alarm system quotation the customer explained that she often looks after a family members dog and that she has to completely omit certain sensors to give a free roam for the dog, we explained about the benefits of upgrading the 15 year old sensors to [pet friendly](/products/pet-package-849/) ones that would mean leaving the system with full protection as well as giving the dog its run around.

We go above and beyond to make sure the customers requirements are met to the highest possible standard.

Of course all wired upgrades benefit from our complimentary backlit siren for the full effect.

We can build any package to suit your property or requirements. Have a look at some of our [packages here](/categories/burglar-alarms/) or [contact us](/contact/) with any questions you may have.
