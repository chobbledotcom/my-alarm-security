We was called out to a home in Belvedere as the homeowner wanted to upgrade their existing house burglar system with a brand new system. Their existing system had served them well for nearly 25 years but as technology advances, the homeowner wanted to be able to set and unset their home burglar alarm system in Belvedere from an app on their phone, anywhere in the world. They also liked the idea of being notified if that house alarm had been activated. We surveryed the property and went through the homeowners requirements. We had a demo kit that we brought along with us to show the homeowner what the sensors and panel looks like. Once a package had been decided, the homeowner booked in to have the alarm system installed the following week. When removing the old system - including the old siren, there was a large unpainted gap that the new siren would not cover. We asked the homeowner if they had any of the paint that had been used on the exterior of the house and luckily they did so we was able to paint around the brand new siren and not leave a big unsightly unpainted gap. The homeowner was well pleased as this was not something they was able to do themselves with the siren being so high up. Luckily we have extra long ladders! Just another example of where we go above and beyond to keep our customers happy.
