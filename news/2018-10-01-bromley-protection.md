We have recently had lots of calls from customers in Bromley, Petts Wood, Chislehurst and Orpington complaining of rising burglaries.

This installation was in a detached property in [Bromley](/pages/bromley/) and they asked for our smart app controlled [burglar alarm security system and our popular CCTV package.](/categories/special-offers/)

They went for perimeter protection with vibration sensors and door contacts on all external windows and doors with movement sensors in each room as confirmation on the app. The app sends live notifications on each sensor triggered then sends confirmation if a second sensor is triggered.

They wanted CCTV to protect each side so we had 2 on the front 2 on the back and 1 one each side.

[Contact us](/contact/) if you have a home or business in Bromley or surrounding areas that you would like to protect.
