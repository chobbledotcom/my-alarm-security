Here at MyAlarm Security, we are constantly keeping our eyes and ears open for the latest technology, versions and new equipment that is on the market. We are lucky enough to have fantastic relationships with our wholesalers, manufacturers and the sales and support teams for our chosen products which are Pyronix and Hik. They are both leading brands in their fields with customers all over the world.

Although these are our chosen brands to install, having been in the security industry for well over 25 years, there isn\'t many systems that we don\'t know. We are often called out to systems where the homeowner cant remember who the original installer of the systems was and they need a service on their alarm system or a battery change in the burglar alarm panel or siren. This is something we are always happy to help with.

Battery changes in alarm panels or the outside siren is something that should be done every couple of years at least to avoid a low battery or fault occurring. We find a lot of calls come from customers who have no idea what the make, model or brand of their system is which is fine. All we ask is for them to email us over a photo of their intruder alarm system and from that we will know the make, model and brand and will know exactly what battery is required. It really is as simple as that.

[CCTV](/categories/cctv/) installations are also on the rise. With a rise in theft of cars and packages left on doorsteps especially in the run up to Christmas, more and more people are choosing to install hard wired cctv that doesn\'t rely on an internet connection. We find that a lot of people are put off by cables systems as they don\'t want unsightly cables running down and across the front, back and sides of their property. Who does?! We hide as much cable as possible making the installation as aesthetically pleasing on the eye as possible. Customers are always so surprised at how well we hide our cables and how well positioned the cables and cameras are and thats because we take pride in our work and strongly believe that a satisfied customer is our biggest achievement. Word of mouth recommendations are by far loads better than any paid advert one can do. Happy customers is paramount to us and that is why we take so much pride in our work.

We are lucky enough to have some lovely customers across New Eltham, Bexley, Bromley, Orpington and surrounding areas who contact us for advice, recommendations for their friends, parents or even if they move house. We had one customer recently who moved up North which was too far for us to go. They sent us over their floor plans and from that we told them exactly what they will need and with that, they found a local company who they contacted and are now happy with their new system and have confidence in their new installer. So its not just current customers who we try to help, we really do try and go above and beyond to help out as much as possible. We offer free advice where we can and try to give our customers as many options as possible as we do strongly believe that good customer service costs nothing and goes a long way.
