Upgrading a 20-Year-Old Burglar Alarm to a Modern Smart Pyronix System – Done the Right Way

At MyAlarm Security, we believe upgrading your home security should never mean compromising on appearance. Recently, we were contacted by a homeowner in Eltham, SE9 looking to modernise their 20-year-old burglar alarm system and bring their home protection into the 21st century with one of our smart Pyronix home burglar alarm systems.

Older alarm systems often do their job very well for many years, but technology moves fast. Over time, parts become outdated, less reliable, and incompatible with modern smart features such as mobile app control and instant notifications.

The Challenge: An Old External Siren Rendered Into the Property

During our initial assessment, we identified a common issue we see with older alarm installations. The existing external siren on the front of the house, which had been installed over two decades ago, had had the the render and pebble-dash removed around it during previous external works on the property. While this was perfectly acceptable at the time, it does present challenges when upgrading to newer equipment.

The new Pyronix external siren we were installing was a different shape and size — slightly smaller, far more discreet, and much more aesthetically pleasing. However, once the old siren was carefully removed, it revealed old pebble dash behind and around the original unit, leaving the potential for the new siren to sit against an uneven and unsightly background.

This is the point where some installers might simply fit the new siren, step back, and leave visible damage or mismatched surfaces behind. That’s not how we operate.

Going the Extra Mile (As Standard)

We positioned the new siren perfectly and removed all of the old pebble dash as possible, ensuring the unit sat flush and securely against the property.

The result? A modern, smart external alarm that looked like it had always belonged there - not an obvious replacement or an eyesore on the front of the house.

Security That Looks as Good as It Performs

This attention to detail is something we take pride in. A burglar alarm should protect your home, deter intruders, and give you peace of mind - but it should also look professional and tidy. Your home is your biggest investment, and every installation we carry out reflects that.

The customer was delighted with both the performance of their new home alarm system and the care taken to ensure the external appearance of their property was respected.
