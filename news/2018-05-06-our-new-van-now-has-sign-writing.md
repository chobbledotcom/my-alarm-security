We was soo excited when ordering our van a few months ago that as soon as we decided on the make and model, we started the designing of our van wrap. When we received our new van in a pristine white it looked amazing but we knew the best way to advertise locally in and around Bexley and Orpington was to get it sign written. Along with a website and leaflets, we decided that having our van sign written lets everyone know what we do. We decided to go with a local company to do our van signage after seeing lots of designs of their work which we were very happy with.

After hours with our designer at their offices in Bexley and lots and lots of amendments to the design, we was given a computer generated preview of our van wrap which looked great. We finally approved the deisgn and we dropped the van off this week in Orpington, Bromley to have the work carried out and are over the moon with the outcome. We think the design looks very vibrant, eye catching and modern.

We decided to keep in with our colours of red and white but also went with black text for our contact details so that they can be easily read and copied by our potential customers as we drive past. Our van wrap includes our MyAlarm logo, our contact details and all of the social networking sites that we are on including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. We also had our QR code put on to the van so when you are passing, you can scan the QR code using your phone which will take you straight to our website. How cool is that?!

With our van parked outside your premises, it also lets anyone passing know that your property is in the process of having one of our security systems installed either a [Burglar Alarms or CCTV](/categories/special-offers/) or both.

With the majority of our local work around Greenwich, New Eltham, Sidcup, Welling, Bexley, Bromley, Dartford and Orpington we are sure to turn some heads. We cant be missed in our van and are confident that our design not only looks good but also signifies what we do.

Let us know what you think?
