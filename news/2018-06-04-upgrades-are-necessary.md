When we get asked to upgrade any [Burglar Alarm System or CCTV System](/categories/special-offers/) in areas such as Sidcup, Bexley, Orpington, New Eltham, Greenwich, Gravesend, Bromley etc, we come across all sorts of abominations.

I really cant understand how some so called engineers can leave a job the way they do sometimes. This particular job the previous engineer had fixed the pir to the wall but hadn\'t fixed it high enough to hide the cable? Such a minor thing but something that would drive me mad as a paying customer. Its just laziness and poor workmanship in our opinion.

We go above and beyond at every single job. Our workmanship has and always will be 10/10. We believe customer satisfaction is the key to success. If you are happy, then you will recommend us to your friends and family. There is no better review, than that of someone you know.

Feel free to [contact us](/contact/) if you have any questions. Our friendly team are always happy to help.
