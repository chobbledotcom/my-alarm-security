Here at MyAlarm Security we like to make our jobs run as smoothly as possible so we make sure our equipment is of top quality.

When installing our [Burglar Alarms or CCTV Systems](/categories/special-offers/) we find that having good quality SDS and HSS drills are a must, we could be drilling any size hole from a 2.5m pilot hole right up to 30mm flush cameras.

We also love our Henry Hoover to make sure the property is as tidy as when we stepped foot inside, this customer from Welling in Kent certainly did.
