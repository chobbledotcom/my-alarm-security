We like to keep you up to date with new products for your home alarm system or business alarm system here at MyAlarm Security.

We had a call from a lady in Dartford on the borders of Greenhithe and Ebbsfleet to quote for an upgrade to an old system but with one difference, the owner was deaf.

We adapt and overcome, obviously first and foremost is the protection of the property against break ins triggering over 100 decibels inside and out but when you are deaf then the sound is never going to alert you.

Our [alarm system](/categories/burglar-alarms/) brand of choice Pyronix have released the sounder/speaker which can be plugged in anywhere in the house and is equipped with a super bright strobe.

The strobe can be setup in different ways so that it lights up upon entry and exit lighting the way to the keypad or front door and flashes upon an activation of the house alarm. The customer also has a strobe in her bedroom which would wake her up if the home alarm was triggered much like her alarm clock or fire alarm system, the bright lights constantly flashing.

We always have solutions to your questions and will go above and beyond to help our customers out.

Dont hesitate to [contact us](/contact/) if you have any questions.
