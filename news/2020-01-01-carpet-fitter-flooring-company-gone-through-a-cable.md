#### Carpet Fitter / Flooring Company Gone Through A Cable

# Carpet fitter or flooring company gone through a cable 

This is something we often get calls about! You are having a new floor fitted or a new carpet laid and the company have accidentally gone through the alarm system wire or have taken a chunk out of the cable. Or maybe you was taking up the old flooring and have gone through a cable. Quite often the flooring company will be aware and will notify the homeowner so therefore the damaged cable is visible and able to be repaired and the system back up and running again, but sometimes the flooring company might not even be aware or didn\'t see the cable underneath the threshold or the underlay for example, so they are not aware that the cable has been damaged.Â  Its only when you come to set the system or notice there are lights flashing - or maybe even the siren is ringing that you realise there is a problem. Lots of people panic when the cable to their system has been damaged but this is something we have lots of experience with and have seen time and time again. If you don\'t know where the damage is, we will be able to find it and repair it, or re-run the cable\... Whatever the issue, we can help. Give us a call on 020 8302 4065. We are based in Sidcup and cover a large area. See our SERVICE AREAS on our drop down menu on our home page for the areas that we cover: [SERVICE AREAS](/pages/thamesmead/)
