# Upgrade to a 4k camera CCTV in Bexley

We\'ve been fitting our 24hour colour CCTV security systems in [Bexley](/pages/sidcup/), Sidcup and all surrounding areas for some time now at 5mp per camera. The images are pure HD, recently the manufacturer released a 4k version which is incredible. The recorder is only capable of streaming 1 out of the 4 channels at the moment as the images are so high quality.

We now give our customers the option to upgrade one of your cameras to 4k for just an additional £50 on the package price, this option is perfect for the front of the property enabling you to digitally zoom in at a higher definition.

These cameras also look great with a silver shroud around the lens. Why not add one to your package and stand out from the crowd.

Our CCTV package is often taken alongside our [home alarm systems](/categories/burglar-alarms/), all [packages can be found here](/categories/special-offers/).

Prices correct at time of publish April 2021 and may change in the future.
