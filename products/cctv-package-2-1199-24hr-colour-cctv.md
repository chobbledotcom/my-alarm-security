Our original 4 camera 24 hour colour CCTV package is still as popular as ever, even with advances in technology.  These cameras deliver bright, full-colour images 24/7, even in extremely low-light conditions. The built-in LED ensures clear colour footage at night by lighting the area, allowing you to see faces, vehicles, and important details that traditional (black and white at night) systems often miss.

The CCTV cameras in this package are all 5 megapixels and use a 2.8mm wide-angle lens, offering excellent coverage for key areas such as driveways, gardens, entrances and internal spaces. These cameras also have a built-in microphone which enables you to listen using one-way audio. Please note that these cameras are not two-way audio. Please see our CCTV Package 2 for our two-way audio CCTV camera systems.

This is a hardwired system with each of the cameras cabled to a high-quality recorder, which provides secure recording, smooth playback and remote viewing through the free mobile app. You can check live footage and review past events directly on your phone from anywhere in the world providing you have internet.

The package includes full professional installation, neat cable management, complete system setup, and a demonstration so you know exactly how to use your new security system. 

Optional upgrades such as extra cameras and increased storage can be added to suit your needs. Please feel free to contact us to book a survey, discuss your options or to get a quote.
