# Pet Package

Our pet package was designed for premises with cats and/or dogs over 24 kg\'s.

The package is designed to cover entry points such as external doors and windows to the rear of the premises with impact sensors which are calibrated to suit the application, this gives the pets free reign without the worry of triggering any pir movement sensors.

The 2 x pir movement sensor are normally placed in the central areas such as hall and landing as a confirmation of movement through the premises.

The pet package incudes 2 x set/unset keyfobs which also pair as remote panic buttons which work up to 60 meters of your main control panel.

All our packages come with a nano contact for the entry/exit door which starts your audible countdown timer to remind you to turn the system off. Our entry and exit timers can be adjusted to suit all scenarios.

Our packages also include an external siren for the front and a decoy for the rear. Our external siren triggers a piezo of around 100db which alerts neighbors and passers by of an activation.

The app is also included within this package which enables you to arm/disarm and receive notifications from anywhere in the world as long as your panel remains connected to your router and you have internet on your mobile devices.

You can customize your package by adding devices or swapping devices to better suit your needs.
