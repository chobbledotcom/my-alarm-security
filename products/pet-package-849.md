Our pet package was designed for premises with cats and/or dogs up to 24 kg\'s.

The package is designed to give your pets free reign without the worry of triggering any movement sensors.

The pet package includes 2 x set/unset keyfobs which also pair as remote panic buttons which work up to 60 meters from your main control panel.

All of our packages come with a door contact for the entry/exit door which starts your audible countdown timer to remind you to turn the system off. Our entry and exit timers can be adjusted to suit your requirements.

Our packages also include an external siren for the front and a decoy for the rear. Our external siren triggers a piezo of around 100db which alerts neighbours and passers by of an activation.

The app is also included within this package which enables you to arm/disarm and receive notifications from anywhere in the world as long as your panel remains connected to your router and you have internet on your mobile devices. The app subscription is free for the first. If you wish to continue using the app after the first year, there is an app subscription fee of £20 per year*. The app is optional and if you choose not to renew your subscription, your system will still work as it should - you just wont be able to remotely access the system or be notified of any activations.

All of our packages and systems can be customised to suit your property and requirements. Additional movement sensors, door contacts, vibration sensors, keypads, keyfobs, keytags and more can be added to any of our packages to better suit your needs.

*App subscription subject to price increase by the developer.
