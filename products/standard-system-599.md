# Standard System

Our standard package was designed to suit most residential premises and is by far our most popular package.

We suggest covering each room on the ground floor which has an entry point such as external doors and windows and at least one upstairs on the landing for general coverage.

All of our packages come with a door contact for the entry/exit door which starts your audible countdown timer to remind you to turn the system off. Our entry and exit timers can be adjusted to suit all scenarios.

The 4 x pir movement sensors cover a 90 degree angle with a 10 meter coverage and can be pet friendly for dogs up to 24 kg\'s.

Our packages also include an external siren for the front of the property and a decoy for the rear. Our external siren triggers a piezo of around 100db which alerts neighbors and passers by of an activation.

The app is also included within this package which enables you to arm/disarm and receive notifications from anywhere in the world as long as your panel remains connected to your router and you have internet on your mobile devices. The app is free for the first year and then requires an annual subscription fee of £20 per year thereafter (subject to increase by the manufacturer) The app is optional and your alarm system will still work as it should, you will just not be able to remotely access the system.

You can customize your package by adding devices or swapping devices to better suit your needs. Additonal items that can be added to any package are door contacts, movement sensors, vibration sensors, additional keypads, keyfobs, keytags and more. We can create any package to suit your property and requirements.
