Our standard package was designed to suit most residential premises and is by far our most popular package.

We suggest covering each room on the ground floor which has an entry point such as external doors and windows and at least one upstairs on the landing for general coverage, however we are happy to do a site survey and go through vulnerable areas, access points and sensor placements with you. 

All of our packages come with a door contact for the entry/exit door which starts your audible countdown timer to remind you to turn the system off. Our entry and exit timers can be adjusted to suit your requirements.

The 4 x pir movement sensors cover a 90 degree angle with a 10 meter coverage and can be pet friendly for dogs and cats up to 24 kg\'s.

Our packages also include an external siren for the front of the property and a decoy for the rear. Our external siren triggers a piezo of around 100db which alerts neighbors and passers by of an activation.

The app is also included within this package which enables you to arm/disarm and receive notifications from anywhere in the world as long as your panel remains connected to your router and you have internet on your mobile devices. The app subscription is free for the first year. If you wish to continue using the app after the first year, there is an app subscription fee of £20 per year*. The app is optional and if you choose not to renew your subscription, your system will still work as it should - you just won't be able to remotely access the system or be notified of any activations.

All of our packages and systems can be customised to suit your property and requirements. Additional movement sensors, door contacts, vibration sensors, keypads, keyfobs, keytags and more can be added to any of our packages to better suit your needs.

*App subscription subject to price increase by the developer.
