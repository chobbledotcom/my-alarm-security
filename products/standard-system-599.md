| Called Matt on the off chance as saw his advert didn\'t cover my area, but he agreed to visit when next in the area which was in a couple of days. He saw what the problem was, fixed it and gave me advice for future. Would definitely use him again, an all round good guy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Alarm constantly beeping in hall and needed it to be disconnected from the mains. Phoned Matt Thursday morning and he said he would call that evening. Arrived at about 6pm, looked at the mains box in garage, disconnected power and job done. Firstly I was delighted he was able to call at short notice and fix my problem but also it was a delight to meet somebody who is good at what they do and does not try and rip you off when the job is done. A great big thank you to Matt and would thoroughly recommend him. |

# Standard System

Our standard package was designed to suit most residential premises and is by far our most popular package.

We suggest covering each room on the ground floor which has an entry point such as external doors and windows and at least one upstairs on the landing for general coverage.

All of our packages come with a nano contact for the entry/exit door which starts your audible countdown timer to remind you to turn the system off. Our entry and exit timers can be adjusted to suit all scenarios.

The 4 x pir movement sensors cover a 90 degree angle with a 10 meter coverage and can be pet friendly for dogs up to 24 kg\'s.

Our packages also include an external siren for the front and a decoy for the rear. Our external siren triggers a piezo of around 100db which alerts neighbors and passers by of an activation.

The app is also included within this package which enables you to arm/disarm and receive notifications from anywhere in the world as long as your panel remains connected to your router and you have internet on your mobile devices.

You can customize your package by adding devices or swapping devices to better suit your needs.
