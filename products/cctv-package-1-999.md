Our brand new 4-camera CCTV package provides a powerful, modern security solution for homes and businesses. This system is designed to give you round-the-clock, ultra-clear monitoring of your property, whether it's a home, office, retail space, or industrial site - internal and/or external. With true 4K - 8 megapixel resolution, each camera captures incredibly crisp detail, ensuring faces, vehicles, and important activity are always clear and easy to see and review.

These brand new cameras deliver full-colour video day and night thanks to advanced smart hybrid light technology. Even in darkness, the cameras maintain bright, vivid colour footage through its built in light which lights up the surrounding area, rather than switching to grainy black-and-white night-time images that we once knew just a few years ago. This makes identifying people, clothing, and vehicles far easier in low-light areas. The system also includes smart human and vehicle detection, allowing it to focus on real intruders rather than false alarms caused by weather, pets, or movement in the background.

Each camera comes with built-in two-way audio, allowing you to listen in and speak through the camera directly from your phone or device app. This is ideal for challenging unwanted or unknown guests or simply communicating with people on site without needing to be there. 

This is a hardwired, fully cabled system that does not rely on your internet to work - which is the case in most DIY cctv systems. The system cannot be 'jammed' as all of the cameras are hardwired back to a recorder where the footage is stored and can be accessed. Live and recorded footage can be accessed through your app. If your internet is down or you cannot access the app for any reason, your system will still be recording with all footage stored on the hardrive.

This CCTV package is a cost-effective, scalable system suitable for all of your security and surveillance needs.  We are able to offer systems with more (or less) cameras. Please feel free to contact us to book a survey, discuss your options or to get a quote.
