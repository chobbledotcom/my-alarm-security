| Friday late afternoon my alarm started going off non stop inside and out after a very short power cut. Could not turn it off. Called Matt after getting no off of net mums it was in the evening and he came out straight away knew exactly what he was doing, checked all sensors etc and my alarm was fixed. I would 100 % recommend Matt and would not hesitate to call him again for any alarm problems or upgrades etc.                                                                                                    |

| Alarm constantly beeping in hall and needed it to be disconnected from the mains. Phoned Matt Thursday morning and he said he would call that evening. Arrived at about 6pm, looked at the mains box in garage, disconnected power and job done. Firstly I was delighted he was able to call at short notice and fix my problem but also it was a delight to meet somebody who is good at what they do and does not try and rip you off when the job is done. A great big thank you to Matt and would thoroughly recommend him. |

# Basic System 

Our basic package was primarily designed for use in properties such as flats, upper maisonettes and some open plan commercial premises.

We suggest covering all rooms with an entry point such as external doors and windows.

All of our packages come with a nano contact for the entry/exit door which starts your audible countdown timer to remind you to turn the system off. Our entry and exit timers can be adjusted to suit all scenarios and personal preferances.

The basic package incudes 2 x set/unset keyfobs which also pair as remote panic buttons which work up to 60 meters of your main control panel. The 2 x pir movement sensors cover a 90 degree angle with a 10 meter coverage and can be pet friendly for dogs up to 24 kg\'s.

Our packages also include an external siren for the front and a decoy for the rear. Our external siren triggers a piezo of around 100db which alerts neighbors and passers by of an activation.

The app is also included within this package which enables you to arm/disarm and receive notifications from anywhere in the world as long as your panel remains connected to your router and you have internet on your mobile devices.

You can customize your package by adding devices or swapping devices to better suit your needs.
