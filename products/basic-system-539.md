# Basic System 

Our basic package was primarily designed for use in properties such as flats, upper maisonettes and some open plan commercial premises.

We suggest covering all rooms with an entry point such as external doors and windows.

All of our packages come with a nano contact for the entry/exit door which starts your audible countdown timer to remind you to turn the system off. Our entry and exit timers can be adjusted to suit all scenarios and personal preferances.

The basic package incudes 2 x set/unset keyfobs which also pair as remote panic buttons which work up to 60 meters of your main control panel. The 2 x pir movement sensors cover a 90 degree angle with a 10 meter coverage and can be pet friendly for dogs up to 24 kg\'s.

Our packages also include an external siren for the front and a decoy for the rear. Our external siren triggers a piezo of around 100db which alerts neighbors and passers by of an activation.

The app is also included within this package which enables you to arm/disarm and receive notifications from anywhere in the world as long as your panel remains connected to your router and you have internet on your mobile devices.

You can customize your package by adding devices or swapping devices to better suit your needs.
