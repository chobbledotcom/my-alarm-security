I cannot fault Matt about anything.  His service was top notch from start to finish.  His communication was fast and responsive.  When he came round for the survey and quote, he was honest and did not try to sell us extras that we didn't need.   He was punctual and fitted the full system within 5 hours.  He made no mess and the workmanship was to a high standard.  He programmed the system then talked me through it.  Easy.  It is a great system that is easy to use and very effective.  If you're looking for home security system, I would highly recommend that you call Matt from MyAlarm Security.
