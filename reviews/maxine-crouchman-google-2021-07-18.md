We have no issues with giving a reference to Matt at My Alarm. Matt was very professional, he listened to what we wanted from our CCTV and Alarm installation and was very helpful with his recommendations. The work was carried out without any hassle and we are very pleased with the product. This is a family run business, so no middle man or franchise, but the level of care and professionalism was second to none. The after sales service is superb, and we would highly recommend Matt and MyAlarm. You will not be disappointed.
