Alarm constantly beeping in hall and needed it to be disconnected from the mains. Phoned Matt Thursday morning and he said he would call that evening. Arrived at about 6pm, looked at the mains box in garage, disconnected power and job done. Firstly I was delighted he was able to call at short notice and fix my problem but also it was a delight to meet somebody who is good at what they do and does not try and rip you off when the job is done. A great big thank you to Matt and would thoroughly recommend him.
