I can’t recommend Matt highly enough.  It took longer to do job (faulty product from Argos and my phone to blame) but Matt still charged agreed price.  He spent time not only explaining the bell but also advised on other non related security issues I asked him about.  He was nothing but polite and helpful even ordering a replacement chime from Argos and returning once in stock 2 days after to complete the job (no extra charge even though that was not his fault).  I have already recommended Matt to family, friends and neighbours and would have no hesitation in recommending him.  Thanks Matt.
