True story, the wheel in my van fell off the other day, literally fell off while I was driving...
I ended up waiting 34 hours to be recovered because I wasn’t covered properly.
I sorted out break down cover the next day (Little good it did me at the time, though!).
I decided rather than wait till I was burgled, I’d ask Matt to sort my home security.
I don’t want to wait till my home is broken in to before I then sort that out, too!
My wife and children are far more important than my van!
It’s always after the fact or post issue that I get things sorted, but this is too important.
Matt was round quickly and scoped everything out. Wasn’t a massive quote at all, was really pleased with it, and all getting done very soon.
Couldn’t be happier.
