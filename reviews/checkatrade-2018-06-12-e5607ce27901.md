Matt offered practical advice both on our existing inherited system and a new Alarm without being at all pushy for business.   We opted for new more tailored system given a rear extension and could include new pet sensors and vibration sensors.  All fitted within a day and Matt is extremely tidy.  Where the new external Alarm box didn't cover entirely where the old box had been Matt even filled in the render and painted around this.  Very happy with system, love the remote activation via the key fobs and the functionality of the mobile app to arm/un-arm the system and receive updates anywhere.
