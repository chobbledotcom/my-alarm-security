Matt came to fix a fault with my Mum's house alarm, and I can't recommend this company enough. It would have been easy for a company to come in and try to up-sell my elderly mum a new alarm system or take advantage, but Matt found and fixed the fault quickly, and also gave her some helpful tips on how to use the alarm properly (which we had been doing wrong for the last 18 years!) I was hesitant about getting a company in to look at the alarm, but I needn't have worried - I would 100% recommend this company, especially for those who are elderly or vulnerable. They are a family run business, and are both trustworthy and reliable. Thank you!
