Very happy with our new alarm installation today. Matt gave a helpful explanation of the options, installation was very neat and accommodating to our needs. Good system and good value, considering it is a professionally installed alarm rather than a DIY kit and not got silly ongoing monthly costs. Would definitely recommend.
