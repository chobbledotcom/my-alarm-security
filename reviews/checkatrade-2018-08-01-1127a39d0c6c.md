I cannot fault the workmanship of Matt.  He worked diligently the entire day, keeping me updated of progress as he went.  He ensured he tidied as he worked and was incredibly put and courteous.  The finished works demonstrate Matt's professionalism and attention to detail.  He spent time demonstrating the system and helped set up the apps on my phone.  Nothing was too much trouble.  I would highly recommend My Alarm to anybody wanting a trustworthy and competent company.
