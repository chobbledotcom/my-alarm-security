Matt was very helpful and gave us some great advice before we agreed to have an alarm fitted.  He knows his stuff but didn't pressure us to buy anything we didn't want.  It was easy to get appointments for a free survey and the installation at suitable times.  Matt was very efficient and his work was of a very high standard.  He explained everything so that we could understand exactly how the system works.  The installation only took a couple of hours, Matt tidied up as he went along and didn't bother us unnecessarily.  We would definitely recommend Matt to anyone looking to have an alarm system fitted.
