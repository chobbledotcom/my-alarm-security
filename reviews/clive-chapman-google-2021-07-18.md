We spent a lot of time researching a new burglar alarm system and are very pleased we chose MyAlarm.     Matt spent a lot of time explaining all options available and we chose the alarm with full HD cctv.    Matt carried out the installation a week later with great respect to our home and fittings.      Work was completed inside of a day, after which Matt cleared up the minimal mess made through drilling etc and although quite late in the afternoon, spent a lot of time fully explaining how to operate the alarm and Cctv.     A first class product and installation by Matt and is highly recommended.
