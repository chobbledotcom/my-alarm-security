Choosing the system I needed was straightforward as the website was set out so clearly and concisely, including the cost. As I was self-isolating, the survey was carried out via facetime, which was perfect.
On the day of fitting, Matt arrived exactly at the time he said he would and was very organised. Once the alarm was fitted, he was so patient too as he helped me set up the app on my phone and made absolutely sure that I was confident in arming/disarming the system. I cannot fault the service I received.
