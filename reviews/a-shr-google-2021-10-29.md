I would highly recommend MyAlarm Security services. I needed to get my alarm serviced. I found MyAlarm Securityâ€™s details on the website as one of the local company around Bexley. I had also come across a recommendation on Nextdoor app for the same company. Therefore, I gave Matt a call and explained the service that I needed. He understood my requirements and provided clear communication. We agreed on the price for servicing my house alarm which was reasonable and competitive amongst the other providers. Matt came around the same day and did the job to my satisfaction. He is knowledgeable in his area of expertise and knows what he is doing. He did a walk through of the alarm system which was helpful. Overall, Matt is professional, friendly and does a good quality job. Hence, I am happy to recommend his services based on my experience.
