I had a house alarm installed at my property as I had an attempted burglary.  They provided a reliable, friendly and professional service.  There engineers were very knowledgeable and advised us what we needed to make our property more secure.  They installed the alarm system in a few hours and showed us how to work it.  They were very tidy and cleaned up as they installed the alarm system.  It’s the best investment I made.  I would definitely recommend them to my friends and family.  I am very happy with the alarm system and it is easy to use.
