# MyAlarm Security - Google Ranking Improvement Plan

A plain-English guide to getting more customers finding you on Google.

---

## How things stand right now

**The good news:** MyAlarm Security already shows up on page 1 of Google for
several searches like "burglar alarm installer Bexley Sidcup". The site has
42 local area pages, 122 five-star reviews, clear pricing, and a genuine
family-business story. That's a strong foundation.

**The challenge:** Several competitors have advantages that Google cares about.
Here's what they're doing that MyAlarm isn't yet:

| Competitor | What they have that MyAlarm doesn't |
|---|---|
| **Spy Alarms** (Orpington) | NSI Gold accreditation, 75,000+ customers served, 64 Yell reviews, location-specific testimonial pages |
| **Fire Action** (Sidcup) | NSI Silver + BAFE accreditation, 19+ years, focuses on commercial |
| **Guardian Alarms** (Bromley) | NSI Gold / NACOSS Gold certificate |
| **Bromley Security Systems** | British & European Standards compliance prominently displayed |
| **DCUK Ltd** (Welling) | Serves same area, broader service offering |

The single biggest gap between MyAlarm and its strongest competitors is
**industry accreditation** (NSI or SSAIB). This matters for Google rankings,
customer trust, AND customers' home insurance.

## What people are actually searching for (and what Google wants to show them)

When someone in Bexley or Bromley types into Google, they're usually searching
for one of these things:

1. **"burglar alarm installer near me"** / **"CCTV installer [town name]"**
   - They want a local, trustworthy company to come and fit a system
   - Google shows the Map Pack (the map with 3 businesses) first, then websites
   - To win here: strong Google Business Profile + local content + reviews

2. **"how much does a burglar alarm cost?"**
   - They're researching before they buy
   - Google shows guides with price ranges and breakdowns
   - MyAlarm has NO content answering this question (big missed opportunity)

3. **"best burglar alarm system UK"** / **"wired vs wireless alarm"**
   - They're comparing options and want expert advice
   - Google shows helpful guides from people who clearly know their stuff
   - This is where E-E-A-T matters most (more on this below)

4. **"burglar alarm service near me"** / **"alarm battery replacement"**
   - They already have a system and need help with it
   - This is a great entry point - help them now and they may buy later
   - MyAlarm mentions servicing but doesn't have dedicated helpful content

---

## What is E-E-A-T and why does it matter?

E-E-A-T stands for **Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness**.
It's how Google judges whether your website deserves to rank highly. Think of
it as Google asking: "Should I trust this website enough to recommend it to my
users?"

Here's how MyAlarm currently scores, and what to improve:

### Experience (do you show real, hands-on experience?)

**Current score: Medium**

- The about page mentions 27+ years experience - good
- There's a photo of Matt and his daughter - good, it's personal
- BUT there are no photos of actual installations or work being done
- No "day in the life" content, no before/after photos of jobs
- No video content showing real expertise

**What to do:**
- Take photos of every job (with customer permission) - the van parked
  outside, the neat cabling, the finished panel on the wall, the tidy camera
  install
- Add these to blog posts like "Burglar alarm installation in [town] -
  here's what we did"
- Even a short phone video of Matt explaining something about alarms would be
  powerful

### Expertise (do you actually know what you're talking about?)

**Current score: Medium**

- The content is good and clearly written by someone who knows alarms
- BUT it doesn't mention specific qualifications or training
- Doesn't mention specific brands installed (Texecom? HikVision? Pyronix?)
- No educational content helping people understand their options
- Competitors like Spy Alarms specifically name their NSI Gold certification
  on every page

**What to do:**
- List Matt's qualifications and any training courses completed
- Name the brands you install and are trained on - people search for
  "Texecom installer near me" and "HikVision CCTV installer Kent"
- Write helpful blog posts answering common questions (see content ideas
  below)

### Authoritativeness (do other people recognise you as an authority?)

**Current score: Medium-Low**

- 122 five-star reviews is excellent... but only 26 are on Google
- No NSI or SSAIB accreditation (this is the single biggest gap)
- Not listed on key industry directories
- No mentions in local press or community groups

**What to do:**
- The #1 priority is to look into getting NSI or SSAIB accreditation (see
  Priority 1 below)
- Ask happy customers to leave a Google review (not just Checkatrade)
- Get listed on local business directories with consistent name, address,
  phone number

### Trustworthiness (can people trust you?)

**Current score: Good**

- DBS checked and insured - mentioned on the site
- Real name, real address, real phone number
- Clear pricing with no hidden costs
- Family business with personal story

**What to do:**
- Add the DBS/insurance info more prominently - maybe a dedicated "Why trust
  us" section
- If you get accredited, display the badges prominently
- Add more specific customer stories with permission

---

## The improvement plan (in order of priority)

### Priority 1: Industry accreditation (THE biggest win)

**What:** Look into getting NSI or SSAIB accreditation.

**Why this matters so much:**
- Google sees accredited companies as more authoritative and trustworthy
- Customers' insurance companies often require an accredited installer -
  right now, a customer choosing MyAlarm might not get an insurance discount,
  but a customer choosing Spy Alarms (NSI Gold) would
- The police will only respond to monitored alarms installed by an accredited
  company
- It's the single thing that most separates MyAlarm from the top competitors

**What the owner needs to do:**
- Visit https://www.nsi.org.uk or https://www.ssaib.org to understand what's
  involved
- It typically means being audited on your work quality, record-keeping, and
  staff training
- Once accredited, add the badge to every page of the website and mention it
  in all marketing

**On the website:**
- Once accredited, the CMS can be used to add the accreditation logo and
  text to the About page and homepage
- Mention it in the meta descriptions too

---

### Priority 2: Fix the page titles and descriptions (quick CMS win)

**What:** The titles and descriptions that show up in Google search results
need rewriting. Right now they're stuffed with location names which looks
spammy to both Google and people.

**Current examples (what Google sees now):**

- Homepage title: *"Burglar Alarm And CCTV Bexley Orpington Bromley Dartford
  Eltham"*
- About page title: *"Home Burglar Alarm System Near Me Bexley Sidcup
  Orpington Bromley Bexleyheath Maintenance and CCTV"*
- Burglar Alarms title: *"Burglar Alarm New Eltham, Sidcup, Bexley,
  Greenwich, Orpington, Bromley, Dartford"*

**What's wrong with these:**
- They read like a robot wrote them - just lists of place names
- Google has said they penalise "keyword stuffing" (cramming in lots of
  keywords unnaturally)
- When a real person sees these in search results, they don't feel
  compelling or trustworthy
- They don't tell the searcher WHY to click

**Better versions (the owner can change these in the CMS):**

| Page | Current title | Suggested title |
|---|---|---|
| Homepage | Burglar Alarm And CCTV Bexley Orpington Bromley Dartford Eltham | MyAlarm Security - Burglar Alarms & CCTV in South East London & Kent |
| About | Home Burglar Alarm System Near Me Bexley Sidcup Orpington Bromley... | About Us - 27+ Years Experience | MyAlarm Security, Sidcup |
| Burglar Alarms | Burglar Alarm New Eltham, Sidcup, Bexley, Greenwich, Orpington... | Burglar Alarm Installation - Wireless & Smart Alarms | MyAlarm Security |
| CCTV | CCTV in New Eltham, Sidcup, Bexleyheath, Greenwich, Orpington... | CCTV Installation - 24hr Colour Cameras | MyAlarm Security |
| Sidcup | Burglar Alarm System Sidcup CCTV Systems In Sidcup, Kent | Burglar Alarms & CCTV in Sidcup | MyAlarm Security |
| Bromley | Burglar Alarm Maintenance Service Bromley... | Burglar Alarms & CCTV in Bromley | MyAlarm Security |

**Same for meta descriptions - current ones:**

- Homepage: *"For all of your home and business security. Burglar Alarm
  Servicing, Burglar Alarm Installation, Alarm Battery and CCTV.. Call
  020 8302 4065 or send an email"*
- Burglar Alarms: *"BURGLAR ALARM Home Security, Business security New
  Eltham, Sidcup, Bexleyheath Greenwich, Orpington, Bromley, Dartford and
  surrounding. Burglar Alarm Maintenance. CCTV."*

**Better versions:**

| Page | Suggested meta description |
|---|---|
| Homepage | Family-run security company in Sidcup, covering Bexley, Bromley, Dartford & beyond. Burglar alarms from £539, CCTV systems, servicing & repairs. 122 five-star reviews. Call 020 8302 4065. |
| Burglar Alarms | Professional burglar alarm installation across South East London & Kent. Wireless, app-controlled smart alarms with pet-friendly sensors. Free survey, upfront pricing. 27+ years experience. |
| CCTV | Professional CCTV installation with 24-hour colour cameras, remote app viewing & 30-day storage. Serving Bexley, Bromley, Dartford & Kent. Free survey. Call 020 8302 4065. |

**How to do it:** Open each page in the CMS editor and update the
"meta_title" and "meta_description" fields. Keep titles under 55 characters
and descriptions under 155 characters.

---

### Priority 3: Boost Google reviews (free, just takes asking)

**What:** MyAlarm has 122 reviews across all platforms but only 26 on Google.
Google reviews are the ones that matter most for ranking in the Map Pack
(the map with 3 businesses that appears at the top of local searches).

**Why it matters:**
- More Google reviews = higher position in the Map Pack
- The Map Pack gets more clicks than any other search result
- Spy Alarms has 64 reviews on Yell alone

**What the owner needs to do:**
- After every job, ask the customer: "Would you mind leaving us a quick
  Google review? It really helps us as a small business."
- Send them the Google review link (you already have one set up)
- Maybe print a small card with a QR code linking to the Google review page
  to hand to customers after a job
- Don't offer incentives for reviews (against Google's rules) - just ask
  nicely
- Aim for 50+ Google reviews as a first target

---

### Priority 4: Write helpful content that answers real questions

**What:** Create blog posts that answer the questions people are actually
typing into Google. This brings people to your website who are thinking about
getting an alarm or CCTV, and positions you as the expert.

**Why it matters:**
- People searching "how much does a burglar alarm cost" are potential
  customers doing their research
- If YOUR website answers their question helpfully, they're more likely to
  call YOU
- Google loves websites that genuinely help people (this is core to E-E-A-T)
- Right now, no one in your local area is doing this well

**Blog post ideas (in order of likely search volume):**

1. **"How Much Does a Burglar Alarm Cost in 2026?"**
   - Cover: basic systems, wireless smart systems, CCTV add-ons, installation
     costs, ongoing costs like app subscriptions and servicing
   - Be honest and transparent - this builds trust
   - Mention your packages as examples with real prices

2. **"Wired vs Wireless Burglar Alarms - Which is Better?"**
   - Explain both options in plain English
   - Give your honest professional opinion
   - Mention that you install wireless systems and why you chose that route

3. **"Will a Burglar Alarm Reduce My Home Insurance?"**
   - Explain how insurance companies view alarms
   - Cover the difference between accredited vs non-accredited installations
   - This is a great reason to get NSI/SSAIB accredited

4. **"Do I Need Planning Permission for CCTV?"**
   - Cover the rules about where you can point cameras
   - GDPR considerations for CCTV
   - This shows expertise and builds trust

5. **"How to Choose a Burglar Alarm Installer (What to Look For)"**
   - Accreditations, insurance, experience, reviews
   - Be honest - even mention what to check (this builds massive trust)
   - Naturally positions MyAlarm as ticking most of these boxes

6. **"Pet-Friendly Burglar Alarms - Everything You Need to Know"**
   - You already mention pet-friendly sensors - expand on this
   - Lots of pet owners search for this specifically

7. **"What to Do If Your Burglar Alarm Keeps Going Off"**
   - Helpful troubleshooting content
   - Positions you as the people to call if they can't fix it
   - Great for bringing in servicing customers

**How to do it:** Write these as blog posts through the CMS. Aim for 500-800
words each. Write as if you're explaining to a friend over a cup of tea - not
formal, not salesy, just helpful. Use photos from real jobs where possible.

---

### Priority 5: Name the brands you install

**What:** Mention the specific equipment brands you install and are trained
on - both on service pages and in blog content.

**Why it matters:**
- People search for things like "Texecom installer near me", "HikVision CCTV
  installer Kent", "Pyronix alarm Bromley"
- Competitor UC CCTV prominently mentions HikVision and ranks well for it
- Naming brands shows expertise and gives Google more things to match you
  with

**What the owner needs to do:**
- On the Burglar Alarms page, mention the alarm brand(s) you install (e.g.,
  Texecom, Pyronix, Risco, whatever you actually use)
- On the CCTV page, mention HikVision or whatever brand you use (you
  already mention "ColorVu" which is HikVision's technology - just say so!)
- In blog posts about installations, mention the equipment used

**How to do it:** Edit the Burglar Alarms and CCTV pages in the CMS to add a
sentence or two naming the brands. Something natural like "We install
[Brand] alarm systems, which we've chosen because..."

---

### Priority 6: Strengthen the About page (E-E-A-T boost)

**What:** The About page is good but could do much more to prove experience
and expertise to Google.

**What to add (through the CMS):**
- **Matt's qualifications and training** - Any courses, manufacturer
  training, certifications? List them.
- **How many systems you've installed** - Even a rough number like "hundreds
  of alarm and CCTV systems" gives credibility
- **Specific experience** - "Senior service engineer manager overseeing all
  engineers" is good, but name the type of companies (large national security
  firms? specific sectors?)
- **Photos of real work** - Installations, the van, tools, equipment. Show
  the reality of the job.
- **A timeline** - "2017: Founded MyAlarm Security. 2018: Expanded into CCTV
  installation. 2020: Reached 50 five-star reviews..." etc.

---

### Priority 7: Make location pages more unique

**What:** The 42 location pages are a great foundation, but many follow a
very similar pattern. Google may see pages that are too similar as "thin
content" and not rank them as well.

**What to do:**
- For the most important areas (Bexley, Bromley, Sidcup, Dartford,
  Orpington, Greenwich), make each page genuinely unique:
  - Mention specific local context (local crime stats, neighbourhood
    features)
  - Reference real jobs done in that area (with permission): "We recently
    installed a 4-camera CCTV system for a family in Bromley..."
  - Add unique FAQs for each area
- For less important areas, the current content is acceptable but could be
  enriched over time

**How to do it:** Edit each location page through the CMS. Even adding 2-3
unique sentences about real jobs in that area makes a difference.

---

### Priority 8: Add FAQs to key pages

**What:** The CMS already supports FAQ sections on every page (this is built
into the template). Adding FAQs helps in two ways:
1. Google often shows FAQ answers directly in search results (more
   visibility)
2. It answers questions that might stop someone from picking up the phone

**Suggested FAQs for the Burglar Alarms page:**
- "How long does it take to install a burglar alarm?"
- "Do you offer a free survey?"
- "Can I keep my pets with a burglar alarm?"
- "What happens if my alarm goes off?"
- "Do you service alarms installed by other companies?"
- "Is there a contract or can I just pay per visit?"

**Suggested FAQs for the CCTV page:**
- "Can I view my CCTV from my phone?"
- "How long is footage stored for?"
- "Do your cameras record in colour at night?"
- "Do I need planning permission for CCTV?"
- "Can I add more cameras later?"

**Suggested FAQs for Location pages:**
- "Do you cover [area name]?"
- "How quickly can you come out to [area name]?"
- "Do you offer free surveys in [area name]?"

**How to do it:** In the CMS, each page has an FAQ section. Add questions and
answers there.

---

### Priority 9: Consistent business listings (local citations)

**What:** Make sure your business name, address, and phone number are exactly
the same everywhere online. Google checks this to verify you're a real,
legitimate business.

**Check and update these listings:**
- Google Business Profile (most important)
- Yell.com
- Thomson Local
- Checkatrade (even if not a paid listing)
- Facebook
- Nextdoor
- Bing Places
- Apple Maps

**The details should be exactly:**
- Name: MyAlarm Security
- Address: 40 Northcote Road, Sidcup, Kent, DA14 6PW
- Phone: 020 8302 4065
- Website: https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk

**Why it matters:** Google cross-references your details across the internet.
If your name is "MyAlarm Security" on your website but "My Alarm Security"
(with a space) on Yell, Google sees that as inconsistent and trusts you
less.

---

### Priority 10: Add structured data for reviews and services

**What:** This is a small technical change that helps Google understand your
website better. "Structured data" is invisible code that tells Google things
like "this is a review" or "this is a local business" in a way it can easily
read.

**What's needed:**
- LocalBusiness schema (tells Google you're a local business with specific
  opening hours, service areas, etc.)
- Review/AggregateRating schema (tells Google about your 5-star reviews)
- FAQ schema (makes FAQs eligible to appear directly in search results)
- Product schema (for the alarm/CCTV packages with prices)

**Note:** This is a technical change that would need to be done in the website
template code, not through the CMS. The website developer (Chobble) would
need to implement this.

---

## Quick wins the owner can do this week through the CMS

1. **Rewrite the homepage title** to "MyAlarm Security - Burglar Alarms &
   CCTV in South East London & Kent"
2. **Rewrite the homepage meta description** to include "122 five-star
   reviews" and the phone number
3. **Add 3-5 FAQs** to the Burglar Alarms page
4. **Add 3-5 FAQs** to the CCTV page
5. **Mention the brands** you install on the Burglar Alarms and CCTV pages
6. **Ask your next 5 customers** to leave a Google review

## Medium-term improvements (next few months)

7. Write 2-3 helpful blog posts answering common questions
8. Add more photos of real installations to the site
9. Strengthen the About page with qualifications and numbers
10. Make the top 6 location pages more unique with local job examples
11. Check and fix all business directory listings

## Longer-term / bigger impact

12. Investigate NSI or SSAIB accreditation (this is the game-changer)
13. Get structured data added by the developer
14. Build up to 50+ Google reviews
15. Consider getting listed in local press or community newsletters

---

## Summary: What matters most

If the owner only does three things, they should be:

1. **Look into NSI/SSAIB accreditation** - It's the single biggest
   competitive disadvantage right now. Every top competitor has it.
2. **Ask every customer for a Google review** - More Google reviews = higher
   in the Map Pack = more phone calls.
3. **Rewrite the page titles and descriptions** - Stop the keyword stuffing
   and write titles that a real person would want to click on.

Everything else builds on top of these three foundations.
