In each package:
I know we talked about it already but just thought id note down everything.

Can we remove the price at the top left that is just above the photo (that also shows the price)

In the description on the right:
Can we remove the title ABOUT
Can we remove where is says basic system in black (underneath the red heading that says basic system - which we can keep) Can we also remove the words Specifications, Reviews, Products Specifications please. This will be the same across all of the products.

CCTV: Same as burglar alarms please - swap the content and packages around and have on one line CCTV Package 1 and CCTV Package 2 and then under that have Ultimate and Supreme (in price order please)
And then the same for the pacakges - delete all of the stuff that Jimis's site randomly added in.

Servicing and Repairs:
Can we remove everything below the last line of the content please that says Contact Us for more information. I can also see that i had hidden internal links back to the location pages that i would like to blend in and not stand out. I obvs forgot to link the other pages as i done them all at various times.

Reviews. Can we make them look like theyve come from Google so they look more legit? Maybe being able to click on them to take you to the original review? I think we have a few on facebook too and maybe one or two on yell (from years and years ago)

Contact. Can we take out our address please? Or make it hidden? I think there was an issue with our google business page and we had to have it on there - but it is also our home address and we dont want people turning up lol.
Also, there is a map on that page in German showing Chobbles location lol.

Im pretty sure that is it for now anyway lol.

I know you mentioned about the meta titles adding My Alarm Security in every one, is this something i can delete myself or would you prefer i dont touch anything for the moment?
