#### New Eltham Burglar Alarm Upgrade

# New Eltham Burglar Alarm Upgrade

Another story of a break-in in **New Eltham and Sidcup** border i\'m afraid to say. The customer did have a **burglar alarm** security system (not fitted by us) but unfortunately wasn\'t working as the system hadn\'t been serviced in years. We specialise in the [maintenance, upgrading and fault finding](/categories/servicing-and-repairs/) on all non DIY alarm security systems.

We pride ourselves on professional security systems and CCTV installation to leave you with the best in security but without knowing we had even been.

The intruders gained access through the glazed section at the rear of the house, through the back door and had as long as they wanted as there was no deterrent of an alarm system that sounded when they gained entry.

We have upgraded their home[ burglar alarm ](/products/standard-system-599/)security system to the latest market leading equipment. The old external siren was around 15 years old and not much of a visual deterrent. As part of all our wired upgrades, we offer a backlit external siren for your home alarm system to give the best deterrent - especially at night when it glows. The old siren was a slightly different shape and left an unsighlty mark on the wall. We never like to leave any mark if we can at all help it, so up the ladders we went to give a lick of paint around the new alarm siren and as you can see from the attached photo theres no sign of any old bell boxes - which you quite often see.

We take a lot of pride in our home security [Burglar Alarms and CCTV Packages](/categories/special-offers/) and are very proud to be serving our local areas in Sidcup, New Eltham, Bexley, Greenwich, Bromley, Orpington and Dartford.
