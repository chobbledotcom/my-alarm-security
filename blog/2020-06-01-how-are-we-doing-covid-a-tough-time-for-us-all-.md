#### How Are We Doing? Covid, A Tough Time For Us All.

# How are we doing?

Hi, we just wanted to let you know how we are getting on in this awful time. We have been carrying out social distancing installations with full ppe in and around the Sidcup, Bexley, Eltham and New Eltham areas with [home security burglar](/categories/burglar-alarms/) alarms and [CCTV installations](/categories/cctv/). We have also helped out a number of people with neumerous security system callouts without even being a customer of ours.

We really try our upmost to help you guys out with whatever you need, from full smart app controlled burglar alarm home security systems and cctv installations to a [simple diagnose and fix](/categories/servicing-and-repairs/) of any proffessionally fitted existing system, whether its one of ours or not, fear not we are here to help and aim to leave you with a fully functional home security burglar alarm system at all times.
