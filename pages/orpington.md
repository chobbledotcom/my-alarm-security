We are a local, family run security company offering the latest in home and business security. We are based in Sidcup right by the borders of New Eltham, but also right beside the A20 so within a few minutes of Orpington (providing the A20 and Crittals Corner roundabout isn\'t backed up) Being so local, we have knowledge of the area and the streets within and surrounding (perfect if you ever need an emergency call out).

We not only install brand new Burglar Alarm Systems and CCTV systems, we also service, fault find, repair, replace devices, upgrade and change alarm battery replacements. We also offer access control and door entry systems and have provided our services to quite a few schools in and around Orpington.

With Orpington being such a large area stretching from Sidcup right down to Pratts Bottom and across from the borders of Crockenhill and Chelsfield right over to Princess Royal Hospital (or the PRU if you\'re local) and Petts Wood. Although Orpington comes under the London Borough of Bromley, I think if you\'ve lived in or near Orpington for most of your life, its classed as Kent. Having so many green spaces around such as the beautiful High Elms Country park, just off of Green Street Green, its hard not to class this area as Kent especially when Kent is renowned for being the Garden of England.

Being located right on the border of London and Kent, the ULEZ expansion was something we never anticipated needing to consider. When it was announced that the ULEZ would extend to Orpington, many of our customers expressed concerns about needing to find another local security provider for their alarm systems or CCTV, or for services like alarm battery replacements and routine maintenance in Orpington and Bromley. To address these concerns, one of our first priorities was ensuring our vehicles met ULEZ standards, allowing us to continue providing CCTV and alarm system installations and maintenance in Orpington, and ensuring that home security services in the area remained uninterrupted.

Providing home security in Orpington has always been one of our favourite places. The roads are easy to navigate and there is no better place for lunch than Michael\'s food truck in Nugents! His curries are just the best! His coffee is lovely too. He has a van right outside Pret a Manger, just opposite Costa coffee in Nugents. Being a non height restrictive car park - which is hard to find and is a struggle for us as we have triple ladders on our van roofs which can reach a height of 9 metres, Nugents is the perfect place to stop by for something quick to eat and drink. With plenty of parking - all free too!

So if you are thinking of having a home security system installed or maybe you need a burglar alarm for your business instead, we can help with it all. We offer brand new installations as well as upgrades. You may already have an alarm system that works just fine but may need a service or a new battery, this is something we can help with. We offer servicing to all brands of alarm system. It doesnt matter that we didnt fit it, we have been in the security trade for a number of years so there isnt any alarm panels out there that we havent come across before.
