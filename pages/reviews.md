> Called Matt on the off chance as saw his advert didn\'t cover my area, but he agreed to visit when next in the area which was in a couple of days. He saw what the problem was, fixed it and gave me advice for future. Would definitely use him again, an all round good guy

> Friday late afternoon my alarm started going off non stop inside and out after a very short power cut. Could not turn it off. Called Matt after getting no off of net mums it was in the evening and he came out straight away knew exactly what he was doing, checked all sensors etc and my alarm was fixed. I would 100 % recommend Matt and would not hesitate to call him again for any alarm problems or upgrades etc.

> Alarm constantly beeping in hall and needed it to be disconnected from the mains. Phoned Matt Thursday morning and he said he would call that evening. Arrived at about 6pm, looked at the mains box in garage, disconnected power and job done. Firstly I was delighted he was able to call at short notice and fix my problem but also it was a delight to meet somebody who is good at what they do and does not try and rip you off when the job is done. A great big thank you to Matt and would thoroughly recommend him.
