# Access Control & Door Entry Systems 

Access control and door entry systems give you full control over who has access to your building and secure areas.

Access control and door entry systems allow access via an electronic reader system that users gain entry with by presentation of an access card/fob rather than a metal key to gain access into the restricted premises and areas. There are a whole range of options available for allowing access including personal identification number (PIN) codes, fobs, ID cards, wristbands, electronic fobs and even biometrics.

Access control offers peace of mind by offering a high level of security as the premises\' entrances are controlled by powerful electromagnets that are released only if an authorised person presents their card/fob to the reader.
