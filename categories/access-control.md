# [Access Control & Door Entry Systems] 

\

[Access control and door entry systems give you full control over who has access to your building and secure areas.]

\

[Access control and door entry systems allow access via an electronic reader system that users gain entry with by presentation of an access card/fob rather than a metal key to gain access into the restricted premises and areas. There are a whole range of options available for allowing access including personal identification number (PIN) codes, fobs, ID cards, wristbands, electronic fobs and even biometrics.]

\

[Access control offers peace of mind by offering a high level of security as the premises\' entrances are controlled by powerful electromagnets that are released only if an authorised person presents their card/fob to the reader.]
