# CCTV Systems 

If you\'re looking to enhance the security of your home or business, then CCTV systems are an increasingly popular solution. With the ability to keep an eye on your premises and loved ones, and to deter unwanted intruders, CCTV systems provide a range of benefits. As well as the peace of mind that comes with monitoring everything that happens on your property, CCTV footage can also be used as visual evidence in the event of a break-in or theft from the property.

At MyAlarm Security, we offer CCTV systems with a minimum storage period of approx 30 days, so you never have to worry about missing an incident. With our remote access, you can view live feeds and recorded video footage from anywhere in the world providing you have an internet connection, via a laptop, phone, or tablet. Our smart search feature also allows you to filter footage by movement or specific time periods, making it easy to review footage quickly.

Our CCTV systems are installed by experienced engineers with a focus on providing the best coverage possible. We understand that cabling can be a concern for some customers, which is why we strive to keep our installations as neat and discreet as possible with minimal cables on show.

Our new 24-hour CCTV packages with Full Colour technology have been particularly popular, and we now offer them alongside our most popular [intruder alarm systems](burglar-alarms.php.html). ColorVu technology provides full-colour images day and night, using a large iris and high-performance sensor to achieve sharp, valuable images even in low light conditions. With full app integration for remote viewing, our ColorVu packages offer the latest in smart technology.

We also offer wireless [Burglar Alarm Systems](burglar-alarms.php.html) that can also be linked with your smart phone or tablet, and fully app-controlled from anywhere with an internet connection. We have a range of packages available on our website, with special offers designed to suit different requirements and properties. Alternatively, you can contact us to discuss your needs and receive personalised advice and a package created to suit you. Take a look at the images below to see the difference between conventional cameras (colour in the day and black and white in the evening) and our ColorVu camera (24hr colour). MyAlarm Security is based in Sidcup on the borders of New Eltham, and we serve surrounding boroughs including [Orpington](/pages/orpington.php), [Bromley](/pages/bromley.php), [Dartford](/pages/dartford.php), [Bexley](/pages/bexley.php), [Gravesend](/pages/gravesend.php), [Sevenoaks](/pages/sevenoaks.php) and [Greenwich](/pages/greenwich.php).

The image below shows the differences at night time between a conventional camera (5mp analogue) and a Colorvu camera. Both camera types show up full colour during the day however the conventional cameras only offer black and white night time imaging. ColorVu cameras provide 24hr colour images.
