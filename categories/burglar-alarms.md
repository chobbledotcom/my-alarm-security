# Burglar Alarms

Why wait until a break in or an attempted break in to have a burglar alarm fitted? With so many burglaries and attempted break-ins, don't leave it until it's too late. Protect what is yours and deter any intruders by installing a **MyAlarm Security Burglar Alarm System**.

Based in Sidcup, [Bexley](/pages/bexley/) on the borders of New Eltham, London and Kent, we offer a free survey/design where our highly skilled engineers will go through all the options with you. We don't send out a sales guy who has never picked up a tool and who just gives you a sales pitch, we send an experienced engineer who knows exactly what they are talking about and can explain all the features of the system that they will be installing along with advising the best positions for the equipment. With over 30 years of experience in domestic and commercial security, our engineers know the equipment and security systems they fit inside out.

We offer the latest in smart technology with Pyronix home and business intruder alarms that can be linked to your smart phone or tablet. We have been installing Pyronix intruder alarm systems for well over 10 years and know the system inside-out. Pyronix burglar alarm systems offer 24/7 app-based monitoring.

**What does the app do?**

The app allows you to access your burglar alarm system from anywhere in the world providing you have internet on your device. You can set and unset the system using the app as well as check the status of your system - is it already set etc. The app will also alert you if your alarm is activated and will notify you which sensor/s have been triggered. An active internet connection and app subscription is required for app use. The app subscription is free for the first year after installation. If you would like to continue with the app, there is a £20\* annual subscription fee to be paid. If you do not wish to resubscribe to the app, this does not affect your alarm system in any way and it can still be set and unset from the panel however you will not be able to remotely access through the app or receive any notifications whilst you are away from the property. (\*The app price is subject to increase by the manufacturer) You can renew your app subscription at any time and can have multiple users under the one subscription.

**Wireless Burglar Alarm System vs Wired Burglar Alarm System**

Wireless technology has come so far over the years and is now as reliable as a wired home security house alarm or business premises alarm system, but without the disruption of adding cables in and around your property. As technology advances, intruder alarm systems nowdays can be fitted into a property in approx half a day (depending on the size of the property). 95% of the burglar alarm systems we install are wireless. Many years ago, all burglar alarm systems were hard wired systems which meant that carpets and floorboards had to come up to run the cables or wires were run round the ceilings or skirtings and clipped around door frames. Wireless technology since then has come so far. The main control panel for our burglar alarm system will always be hard wired (even with a wireless system). Devices such as door contacts, movement sensors, panic buttons, keypads etc are then added to the system wirelessly. Pyronix systems utilises two-way wireless technology, which ensures reliable, secure, and encrypted communication between devices, including an anti-jamming mechanism - unlike DIY systems which can be purchased in Argos or B&Q and can be easily hacked or bypassed - or goes down if you have an internet disruption.

**How much does a Burglar Alarm cost?**

We offer free no obligation survey where we will go through with you the best placements for the sensors so that all entry points are covered - front door, rear doors, bi-folds, windows, hallway, landing, garage etc. We also bring along a demo kit to all of our surveys so that you can see the equipment before making your decision. Pyronix wireless devices are all battery powered. We suggest that batteries in the devices should be replaced every year to avoid any low battery warnings. The panel which is mains powered will also have a back up battery should you ever have a power cut. The external siren - normally placed on the front of the property, will also have a battery. If you are upgrading your system and have a cable in place from an older existing system for an external siren,  we may be able to use this to power the new siren - which will also have a battery back up incase of a power cut. If you do not have a cable in place from an existing system, the new siren can be added wirelessly and will work in the exact same way.

We can still install hard wired systems however these are most commonly done during property renovations where the floors and walls have yet to be added and would require at least two visits with the first visit to run the cables (first fix) and then the second visit (second fix) would be done after all of the works are completed and the sensors are ready to be put into their location.

A wireless system is just as reliable as a wired system. All of the devices that are added to the panel will be named ie 'front door' or 'office' etc. If ever there is an issue with one of the sensors, you will be alerted on the panel. The panel displays descriptive messages such as 'low battery on the front door' or 'alarm activation on the office sensor' for example.

Battery changes can be done during an alarm system service. It is recommended to replace device batteries every 12 months and panel and siren batteries every 2 years. 

We have created some packages which have been extremely popular, however we can also tailor build any package to suit your property or requirements. Additional movement sensors, vibration sensors, door contacts, [strobe lights](/blog/wireless-sounder-alarm-system-for-the-deaf-or-hard-of-hearing/) for those who are deaf or hard of hearing, key fobs and key tags can be added to (or removed from) any of our packages.

We also offer pet friendly sensors so that your animal friends do not activate the alarm when it is set. These pet friendly motion sensors can be used for pets up to approx 24kg and are a great way of keeping peace of mind whilst leaving your pets to roam their home.

All of our burglar alarm systems can be programmed with various settings so you can have a 'full set' for when you are out of the house which would arm all of the sensors and contacts or a night time set which arms certain sensors whilst you sleep (allowing you to go to the bathroom during the night for example without setting the whole alarm off). You can also pick and choose within the app to arm/disarm any of the sensors at any time.

**Servicing and maintenance of your Burglar Alarm system.**

As with everything, equipment and batteries have a life span. The manufacturer suggests that internal batteries for wireless systems can last approximately 12-18 months but should be replaced annually to avoid any low battery system faults. We recommend that panel batteries and the external bell siren battery should be replaced every 2 years unless showing as a low battery fault on your panel before this time. We offer one-off or burglar alarm system maintenance without being tied into a contract.

**Already have an alarm?**

Have an existing alarm system that you would like looked at, [serviced, repaired or upgraded](/categories/servicing-and-repairs/)? Maybe it needs some battery changes or is showing a fault? Or if you wanted to just have a burglar alarm system maintenance to make sure that everything is working as it should. We've been in the trade for well over 30 years and know most alarm system brands - both old and new, so don't hesitate to get in contact. We service alarm systems both old and new regardless of who it was installed by. So if your system needs an alarm battery or a new sensor, [Contact Us](/contact/) and we can help. Don't worry if you don't know the make or model of your system, just send us a photo of the panel and we can ID it for you. From replacing a worn keypad to a full upgrade we can do it all.
