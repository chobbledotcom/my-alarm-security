## CCTV in Eltham

We also offer the latest in CCTV packages. Our 24 hour colour CCTV cameras have been extremely popular. With colour imaging night and day compared to older systems where the night time images were in black and white, these cameras will capture unique details compared to grey images from the older style cameras. Our hard wired CCTV systems do not rely on an internet connection, so if your internet is down, your cameras will still be recording with the footage stored on to its hard drive. Our CCTV systems also offer remote viewing so that you can login to your system from anywhere in the world and view live footage and playback recordings.
